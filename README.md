# logstash-plugin-dev
This logstash plugin development container for (J)Ruby plugins originally was a fork of 
[`cameronkerrnz/logstash-plugin-dev`](https://github.com/cameronkerrnz/logstash-plugin-dev).
As I'm (currently) not interested in support for Java plugins, I decided to start from scratch
based on the official logstash container image provided at https://www.docker.elastic.co/.
