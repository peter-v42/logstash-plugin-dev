# `logstash-plugin-dev` container image
This logstash plugin development container for Java plugins originally was a fork of 
[`cameronkerrnz/logstash-plugin-dev`](https://github.com/cameronkerrnz/logstash-plugin-dev).
As I'm not (yet) interested in support for (J)Ruby plugins, I decided to start from scratch
based on the official logstash container image provided at https://www.docker.elastic.co/.

# Using the container image
As my version of the `logstash-plugin-dev` container image is available from my [`docker.io` container registry](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/v42net/logstash-plugin-dev/general), there is no need to [build the image](BUILD.md) before you can use it for developing your own Logstash Java Plugin.
